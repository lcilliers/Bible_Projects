# Tier Catalogue — Restructured (Two-Layer Slice) · v2 · 2026-06-11

> **Supersedes v1** ([`wa-tier-catalogue-restructured-v1-20260610.md`](archive/wa-tier-catalogue-restructured-v1-20260610.md)) and the original flat extract ([`wa-tier-questions-extract-v1-20260604.md`](wa-tier-questions-extract-v1-20260604.md)).
> **v2 adds the consolidated VE questions + the full source-question text.** For each verse-extraction field, the originating tier questions are **analysed and merged into a single verse-level question that the field answers**, with **every combined aspect retained**. Each block now also quotes the **originating tier questions in full** so the consolidation can be evaluated against its source as a whole. Only the cross-verse *reveal/pattern/over-time* clauses route to SYNTH (noted per field).
> **For approval — DB not yet modified.** Old T-codes remain the reference key (numbering expected to change); `VE-nn` IDs are provisional.

## 0. The two layers

| Layer | grain | what it is | where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A · Verse-Extraction (L1/L2)** | one typed term-in-verse | structured fields with **closed option-lists** — the *evidence*, state-not-induce (NONE/SILENT/not-stated first-class) | the L2 read → `finding` (l2_api) → **`v_l2_tier`** |
| **B · SYNTH** | characteristic / cross-verse / cross-term / cross-cluster | the *"what does X reveal"*, *over-time*, *pattern*, *relationship* questions — **computed by rolling up** Layer A | the synthesis pass |

Every old question is dispositioned **→ Layer A** · **SYNTH** · **DROP** · **DEFER** (§5 indexes all 189).

---

## 1. Layer A — Verse-Extraction fields, each as **one consolidated question**

Each block: **VE-id · field** — the single **consolidated verse-level question** (what the field answers) — option-list · `M/R` · live? — the **originating tier questions in full** (the questions merged) — **aspect(s) routed to SYNTH** (so nothing is lost).

- option-list: clean sense phrase · `M` · **live**
- **merges — the originating tier questions in full:**
    - **T7.1.3** — "What is the semantic range of the primary term — across what breadth of meaning does it operate?"

    - **T0.4.3** — "If no typological use is evidenced, note this explicitly." *(→ `none`)*
- → SYNTH: whether Scripture uses the characteristic typologically as a body (T0.4.1 across)

- → SYNTH: what the form requires for responsible interpretation (T7.2.2 clause 2); the verse's function/argument/anchor (T7.2.1, T7.2.3, T7.2.5, T7.2.6)

### VE-15 · `relational_direction` *(multi — proposed)*
**Q — "In which relational direction does the term operate in this verse, and how — from God toward the person (divine→human), in the person's movement toward God (human→divine: seeking, supplication, worship, covenant), extended from one person to another (giving), received by a person from another (receiving), or in relation to other spiritual beings (angelic or adversarial) — recording each that applies, or NONE?"**

    - **T6.1.1** — "Which adjacent characteristics appear most frequently alongside this one in the verse evidence?"
- → SYNTH: the co-occurrence **pattern** and what it reveals (T6.1.2/.3); the **typed** relationship between co-occurring terms is a separate gap (see verse-extraction-gaps reflection)

> **Cross-reference is exact and live in the DB:** every `l2_api` finding links to its old code via `finding_question_link → wa_obs_question_catalogue.question_code` (the `v_l2_tier.question_code` column). VE-05/07/15 are multi-select — each present value is one linked finding; absence = `NONE`.

## 2. Layer B — SYNTH (roll-up / relationship / dynamic)

Computed across verses / terms / clusters; never asked at the verse. Grouped by old tier (codes are the reference; final SYNTH numbering TBD). "Fed by" names the Layer-A field(s) the roll-up consumes.

| old code(s) | SYNTH question (de-forced where noted) | fed by |
|---|---|---|
| T0.1.1 · T0.1.3 | What the God-attribution / its silence reveals about the characteristic's nature & divine-image significance | VE-08 |
| T0.2.2 · T0.2.3 | Original-design vs response-to-the-fall; orientation to future fullness | VE-09, VE-12 |
| T0.3.1–.3 | Image-bearer expression — how it instantiates the divine likeness; shared vs analogue; presence/absence & image condition | VE-08, corpus |
| T0.4.1 | Whether Scripture uses the characteristic typologically at all | VE-10 |
| T1.1.1 · T1.1.2 | Programme name & what it signals; definitional read of the H/G terms | VE-01 across |
| T1.3.1–.3 | Boundary — structural opposite; what it excludes/resists; where it ends | VE-01, vocabulary |
| T1.4.1 · T1.4.3 | The full **mode-set**; the speech-based mode | VE-04 across |
| T1.5.2 | Is the immediate response consistent or variable? | VE-11 across |
| T1.6.2 · T1.6.3 | States/qualities established over time; sustained vs immediate | VE-12 across |
| T1.7.1–.3 | Conditions of reception — enabling / blocking / non-receiver state | VE-09, VE-12, corpus |
| T2.1.2/.3 · T2.2.2 · T2.3.2 · T2.4.2 · T2.5.2 · T2.6.2 | What each location **reveals** | VE-05 across |
| T2.7.1/.2 | Body↔soul direction & consequence | VE-05 (body) |
| T2.9.2/.3 | Origin singular vs multiple; origin changing across contexts | VE-06 across |
| T2.10.1–.3 | Constitutional **movement** across levels | VE-05 across |
| T3.x.2 (×11) | Does it **enable / deepen / bypass / impair** faculty X? | VE-07 across |
| T3.x.3 (×11) | What the **pattern** of engagement reveals | VE-07 across |
| T3.10.1–.3 | **Conscientiousness** (integrated composite) | VE-07 (affect/volition/agency/moral-eval/conscience) |

## 3. DROP — removed (programme constructs / no verse referent)

| old code(s) | question | reason |
|---|---|---|
| **T1.2.3** | "best working description" | a programme write-up step, not an observation |
| **T1.8.1–.3** | Dimension Classification | the *dimension* construct is retired |
| **T2.8.1–.3** | Body-Deposit (DNA / generational) | speculative construct — extracts something not in the evidence |
| **T5.7.1–.3** | Deposit Consequence | depends on the dropped T2.8 |
| **T6.6.1–.3** | Shared Verse Anchors | "anchor" is a VCG/programme construct; co-occurrence (T6.1 → VE-17) covers it |
| **T6.7.1–.3** | Dimensional Sharing | dimension construct |

**Defer (not dropped):** **T7.3.1–.4** Human Science Frameworks — external lens, not inner-being verse evidence; revisited in synthesis.

---

## 4. DE-FORCE — forcing questions rephrased to neutral checks (silence first-class)

The tell is *"what does X reveal / suggest"* or *"in what way does it express Z"* — these prompt a finding that may not exist. Rephrased to *"is there evidence of X here? — record it; if not, silent."* The verse check lands in a Layer-A field (now the consolidated question above); the original "reveal" becomes SYNTH.

| old code | original (forcing) | de-forced verse check → field |
|---|---|---|
| T0.1.2 | "what does the attribution reveal about its significance…" | **Is the term related to God here?** → VE-08 |
| T0.2.2 | "original design *or* response to the fall?" | **note only if the verse states a purpose** → VE-09 |
| T0.3.1/.3 | "in what way does it express the divine image… presence/absence reveal" | **Does the verse tie the term to the image of God?** (rare) → SYNTH |
| T2.x.2 | "what does X-location reveal" | **Is it located at X here?** → VE-05 |
| T3.x.2 | "does it enable/deepen/bypass/impair faculty X" | **Which faculty(ies) does it engage here?** → VE-07 |
| T3.x.3 · T1.5.2 · T1.6.x | "what does the pattern reveal" | — (SYNTH only) |
| T5.4.x | "does suffering deepen/test/reveal/produce it" | **Does the verse place the term in suffering?** (+ role) → VE-16 |

| **D5** | Confirm the **M/R** split per §1 | per the `M/R` tags |
| **D6** | New numbering — keep T-codes, or assign `VE-nn` + `S-…`? | retain old T-codes as the reference key; assign new IDs on sign-off |
| **D7** | Approve the **consolidated VE questions** in §1 as *the* verse-level questions the read answers | review wording against the now-embedded source text; these supersede asking the originating sub-questions individually |

### Provenance
- Supersedes: `wa-tier-catalogue-restructured-v1-20260610.md` (no consolidated questions / no source text) and `wa-tier-questions-extract-v1-20260604.md` (flat 189).
- Designs applied: `wa-verse-level-extraction-spec-v1-20260609.md`, `wa-catalogue-refit-two-layer-v1-20260609.md`; gaps flagged in `wa-verse-extraction-gaps-v1-20260610.md` (cause-side fields are a *separate, additive* proposal, not folded here).
- Source-question text quoted in §1 is pulled verbatim from `wa_obs_question_catalogue` (live, 2026-06-11).
- Live cross-reference: VE-01..14 ↔ old codes are linked in the DB via `finding_question_link`; queryable through `v_l2_tier.question_code`.
- **DB unchanged.** On approval: migration to tag `wa_obs_question_catalogue` with `layer` (A/SYNTH/DROP/DEFER), store each VE's consolidated question + its originating-code set, and apply the de-force rewordings.
